These files are all compiled CIL files generated with the lscript harness in
https://github.com/SaladDais/lscript-tailslide. All added testcases should
be generated the same way to ensure conformance with LL's codegen.

There are some slight differences in the CIL generated by that harness compared
to the official compiler for sanity's sake:

* `ldc.i4 0` and `ldc.i4 1` are always compiled as `ldc.i4.0` and `ldc.i4.1`.
* Doubles are always serialized in their hex form to preserve
  precision and avoid having separate code paths for default initializers vs constant initializers.
* User-defined labels are always prefixed with "ul" to prevent collisions with compiler-defined labels.
* Some whitespace and consistency changes (mainly around use of `class`) that don't affect compilation
